## Introduction

Instacart Grocery Data Analytics is a Scala-based project that utilizes Apache Spark to analyze millions of grocery orders. The primary goal is to uncover insights into customer behaviors, such as frequently bought together items, repeat purchase patterns, and segmenting customers based on their shopping habits.

By leveraging distributed computing, the project efficiently processes large datasets, providing actionable insights that can be used by retailers to optimize marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

## Features

- **Scalable Data Processing**: Analyze large datasets using Apache Spark for distributed computing.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Group customers by purchasing behavior and order frequency.
- **Market Basket Analysis**: Identify frequently bought together items using association rules.
- **Reorder Patterns**: Analyze repeat purchases and time intervals between orders.
- **Data Visualization**: Use Spark's integration with visualization libraries to generate insightful plots.
